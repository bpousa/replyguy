## Subject: Important Update: Your ReplyGuy Trial Billing Correction

Dear [Customer Name],

We recently discovered a billing configuration error that affected your ReplyGuy trial subscription. We've already corrected this issue, and we want to be transparent about what happened and what it means for you.

## What Happened?

When you signed up for your $1 trial, our system incorrectly configured your subscription to continue billing at $1/month after the trial period, instead of the regular subscription price.

## What We've Done:

We've corrected your subscription settings. Here are the details:

- **Your trial continues as normal** until August 17, 2025
- **After your trial ends**, you'll be billed at the correct price:
  - X Basic Plan: $19/month (for antoni.mike+36@gmail.com)
  - X Pro Plan: $49/month (for antoni.mike+35@gmail.com)
- **No immediate charges** - this change only affects billing after your trial ends

## What You Need to Do:

Nothing! Your trial continues exactly as before. You can:

- Continue enjoying all the features of your plan
- Cancel anytime before August 17, 2025 if you don't wish to continue
- Keep your subscription to be automatically billed at the regular price after the trial

## As an Apology:

We sincerely apologize for this error. To make it right, we're extending your trial by an additional 7 days at no cost. Your new billing date will be August 24, 2025.
