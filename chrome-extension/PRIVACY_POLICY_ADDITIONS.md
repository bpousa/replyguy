# Privacy Policy Additions for Chrome Extension

Add the following sections to your privacy policy at https://replyguy.appendment.com/privacy to ensure Chrome Web Store compliance:

## Browser Extension Data Collection

### Chrome Extension Specific Data

When you use the Reply Guy Chrome Extension, we collect and process:

- **Browser Storage Data**: We use Chrome's local storage API to save your authentication tokens and user preferences. This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless necessary for authentication.

- **Cookie Data**: The extension accesses cookies solely for authentication purposes with replyguy.appendment.com. We do not track or access cookies from other websites.

- **Active Tab Information**: When you click the Reply Guy button on a tweet, the extension reads only the content of that specific tweet to generate a reply. We do not continuously monitor or collect your browsing data.

- **Host Permissions**: The extension requires access to twitter.com and x.com domains solely to inject the Reply Guy interface and read tweet content when you explicitly request it.

### Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: User preferences, authentication tokens, and temporary data are stored using Chrome's secure storage APIs
- **Session Storage**: Temporary session data is cleared when you close your browser
- **No Background Tracking**: The extension only activates when you explicitly click the Reply Guy button
- **Minimal Permissions**: We only request the minimum permissions necessary for functionality

### Data Transmission

The Chrome extension transmits data to our servers only when:
- You authenticate your Reply Guy account
- You generate a reply (tweet content and your input are sent for processing)
- You request real-time research (if enabled)
- Usage statistics are updated (reply count only, no content)

### User Control and Data Deletion

For the Chrome Extension specifically:
- You can clear all extension data by removing the extension from Chrome
- Local storage can be cleared through Chrome's settings
- You can revoke the extension's permissions at any time through Chrome's extension management
- Uninstalling the extension immediately removes all locally stored data

### Third-Party Services

The Chrome extension communicates with:
- **replyguy.appendment.com**: For authentication and API access
- **AI Providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity): For reply generation (content is processed but not stored by these providers)
- No other third-party services have access to your browsing data

### Updates to Extension Permissions

If we need to update the extension's permissions in future versions:
- You will be notified through Chrome's permission request system
- You can review changes before accepting the update
- You may continue using the current version if you decline new permissions

### Chrome Web Store Compliance

This extension complies with Chrome Web Store policies by:
- Using permissions only for stated functionality
- Not collecting user data beyond what's necessary for the service
- Providing clear disclosure of all data practices
- Implementing secure data handling practices
- Respecting user privacy choices

## Cookie Policy for Chrome Extension

The Reply Guy Chrome Extension uses cookies in the following limited ways:

1. **Authentication Cookies**: We access cookies from replyguy.appendment.com domain only to maintain your login session
2. **No Third-Party Cookie Access**: The extension does not read or modify cookies from any other websites
3. **No Tracking Cookies**: We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising purposes
4. **Session Management**: Cookies are used solely to keep you logged in while using the extension

You can manage cookie preferences through your Chrome browser settings. Disabling cookies for replyguy.appendment.com will require you to log in each time you use the extension.
