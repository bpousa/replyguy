# ReplyGuy AI Prompts Documentation

This document contains all the AI prompts used throughout the ReplyGuy system for reference and debugging.

## 1. Research Query Generation (GPT-4o)

**File**: `app/api/research/route.ts`
**Model**: GPT-4o
**Purpose**: Generate search queries for Perplexity AI to find current statistics and facts

### With User Guidance
```
The user has provided specific research guidance: "{guidance}"

Generate a search query that will find EXACTLY what the user requested.
Focus on finding:
- Recent statistics or data (last 1-2 years)
- Current trends and percentages
- Official reports or studies
- Specific numbers and facts

Make the query specific and include relevant terms like "statistics", "data", "report", "study", "percentage", "trends", "recent", "latest", etc.

Search query:
```

### Without User Guidance
```
Context:
Tweet: "{originalTweet}"
User's response idea: "{responseIdea}"

Generate a search query to find relevant CURRENT information, statistics, or trends about this topic.

Guidelines:
- Focus on recent data (last 1-2 years) to provide information beyond typical LLM knowledge cutoffs
- Include terms that will return concrete numbers, percentages, or specific facts
- Consider what statistics would be most relevant to the user's response idea
- If location matters, include it (USA, global, specific cities)
- Think broadly - could be economic data, social trends, tech stats, health data, etc.

Good query patterns:
- "[topic] statistics recent trends report"
- "[topic] data percentage change latest"
- "[topic] current numbers study [location]"
- "recent [topic] rates statistics trends"

Search query:
```

## 2. Perplexity Search Request

**File**: `app/api/research/route.ts`
**Model**: Perplexity sonar-small-online
**Purpose**: Search for current statistics and factual data

```
Search for: {searchQuery}

Return ONLY concrete statistics, facts, and data with specific numbers. Focus on:
- Recent statistics (last 1-2 years preferred) that would be beyond typical AI knowledge
- Exact percentages, numbers, or measurable trends
- Credible sources (government reports, studies, official data)
- Current events or developments related to the topic

Format your response as bullet points with specific data points. Examples:
- "X increased/decreased by Y% in 2024 according to [Source]"
- "[Location] reported Z [metric] as of [Date]"
- "Study shows [specific finding with numbers]"

IMPORTANT: Focus on providing factual, numerical data that directly relates to the search query. Include diverse statistics if available, not just one type of data.
```

## 3. Reply Type Classification (GPT-4o)

**File**: `app/api/classify/route.ts`
**Model**: GPT-4o
**Purpose**: Select the 3 best reply patterns from filtered list

### System Message
```
You are an expert at matching tweet contexts to appropriate reply patterns. Return only the numbers of your top 3 choices, separated by commas.
```

### User Prompt
```
Given this tweet: "{originalTweet}"
User wants to say: "{responseIdea}"
Tone: {tone}
{Additional context: {perplexityData} (if available)}

Select the 3 best reply patterns that would allow the user to naturally express their idea:
{candidateList}

CRITICAL: Choose patterns that best support expressing the user's intended message.
Consider:
1. Which patterns allow the user to say what they want?
2. Which match the desired tone?
3. Which fit the context?

Return only the numbers of your top 3 choices, separated by commas.
```

## 4. Reply Type Reasoning (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

**File**: `app/api/reason/route.ts`
**Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Purpose**: Choose the single best reply type from the top 3 candidates

### System Message
```
You are an expert at understanding social media culture and selecting appropriate response patterns. Be concise and analytical.
```

### User Prompt
```
Context:
- Tweet: "{originalTweet}"
- Intent: {responseIdea}
- Desired tone: {tone}
- Research data: {perplexityData} (if available)

Reply pattern options:
{typeDescriptions}

Analyze which pattern would create the most natural, engaging, and appropriate response.
Consider:
1. Which pattern best matches the user's intent?
2. Which fits Twitter culture and conventions?
3. Which allows natural incorporation of the tone and any research data?

{Meme instructions if enabled:
Also decide if a meme would enhance this reply. Memes work best for:
- Humorous or sarcastic tones
- Relatable situations
- Making a point through humor
- Reactions to absurd situations

If a meme would help, provide concise text (max 100 chars) that captures the essence.}

Provide your response in this exact format:
Choice: [number] - [one sentence explanation]
{Meme: [yes/no] - [meme text if yes, or "none" if no] (if memes enabled)}

Be decisive and specific.
```

## 5. Final Reply Generation (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

**File**: `app/api/generate/route.ts`
**Model**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet
**Purpose**: Generate the final human-like reply

### System Message
```
You are a real person on Twitter having a genuine conversation. Your PRIMARY job is to express the user's intended message while sounding natural and human. The user has told you exactly what they want to say - honor that above all else. Never ignore or override their intent. Make it sound authentic and conversational, but the core message must be what they requested.
```

### User Prompt (with Research Data)
```
Original tweet: "{originalTweet}"

üö® CRITICAL RESEARCH DATA - MUST INCLUDE IN YOUR REPLY:
{perplexityData}

## Cost Tracking

- **GPT-4o**: $2.50 per 1M input tokens, $10.00 per 1M output tokens
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: $3.00 per 1M input tokens, $15.00 per 1M output tokens

## Anti-AI Detection Patterns

The system actively avoids these AI-generated text patterns:
- Generic openings: "Great point", "Absolutely", "Indeed"
- Corporate buzzwords: "leverage", "optimize", "streamline"
- Formal transitions: "Moreover", "Furthermore", "Additionally"
- Excessive enthusiasm or positivity
- Overuse of emojis (max 1 per reply)
- Em dashes and semicolons
- Essay-like structure

Instead, it aims for conversational, human-like responses that sound like natural Twitter interactions.
