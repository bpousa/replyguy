# Daily Goal & Usage Tracking Test Report

**Test Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Test Account**: test-pro@replyguy.com (X Pro Plan)  
**Test Duration**: ~10 minutes

## 📊 Executive Summary

The daily goal feature shows **mixed results**. While the default goal of 10 replies/day is properly set and the UI persists correctly, there are critical issues with usage tracking that prevent the counter from incrementing when replies are generated.

## 🔍 Test Results

### 1. Daily Goal Default ✅ WORKING
- **Default Value**: 10 replies/day (as expected)
- **Display**: "0 of 10 replies today"
- **Settings Page**: Shows daily goal input with value "10"
- **Persistence**: Goal setting persists across page refreshes

### 2. Reply Generation ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Form Submission**: ✅ Successfully filled and submitted
- **Reply Generation**: ✅ Reply appears to generate (UI shows loading)
- **Visual Feedback**: ✅ "Generate Reply" button works
- **Error During Generation**: ❌ Console shows "Failed to generate reply" error

### 3. Daily Goal Counter ❌ NOT INCREMENTING
- **Before Reply**: 0 of 10 replies
- **After Reply**: 0 of 10 replies (no change)
- **After Refresh**: 0 of 10 replies (still no change)
- **Issue**: Counter does not increment despite reply generation attempt

### 4. Monthly Usage Counter ✅ PERSISTS
- **Current Usage**: 7 / 24 replies this month
- **After Refresh**: 7 / 24 replies (persisted correctly)
- **Note**: This appears to be historical usage, not updating with new replies

### 5. Settings Page ✅ FUNCTIONAL
- **Daily Goal Input**: Editable, shows value "10"
- **Range**: 1-100 replies per day
- **Timezone**: Eastern Time (ET) properly set
- **Plan Display**: Shows current subscription tier

## 🚨 Console Errors Found

Multiple server errors were detected:
- **500 Internal Server Error** - Multiple occurrences
- **406 Not Acceptable** - Multiple occurrences  
- **404 Not Found** - Some API endpoints missing
- **"Failed to generate reply" error** - During reply generation

### Error Pattern Analysis:
The 500 and 406 errors appear to be related to usage tracking APIs failing to update the counter when a reply is generated.

## 📸 Visual Evidence

1. **Initial Dashboard**: Shows "0 of 10 replies today" with progress bar
2. **Reply Form**: Successfully filled with tweet and response idea
3. **After Generation**: Reply appears to be generating but counter remains at 0
4. **Settings Page**: Shows daily goal set to 10 and monthly usage at 7/24

## 🔧 Technical Findings

### What's Working:
- ✅ Daily goal default value (10)
- ✅ Goal setting persistence in UI
- ✅ Monthly usage display and persistence
- ✅ Settings page functionality
- ✅ Form submission process

### What's Broken:
- ❌ Usage tracking API (500/406 errors)
- ❌ Daily counter increment logic
- ❌ Reply generation completion tracking
- ❌ Real-time usage updates

### Root Cause Analysis:
The usage tracking appears to fail at the API level when attempting to record a new reply. The frontend correctly maintains the goal settings, but the backend fails to:
1. Track when a reply is successfully generated
2. Update the daily counter
3. Update the monthly usage in real-time

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Fix Usage Tracking API** - Resolve 500/406 errors
2. **Implement Proper Reply Tracking** - Ensure successful replies increment counters
3. **Add Error Recovery** - Handle API failures gracefully
4. **Fix Missing Endpoints** - Address 404 errors

### User Impact:
- Users cannot track their daily progress
- Monthly usage may not reflect current activity
- Goal setting works but provides no meaningful feedback

## 📋 Test Details

### Test Scenario:
1. Logged in with Pro account
2. Checked default daily goal (10)
3. Generated test reply with realistic tweet
4. Monitored counter changes
5. Refreshed to test persistence
6. Checked monthly usage in settings

### Sample Data Used:
- **Tweet**: "Just launched my new AI startup! We're building the future of customer service with LLMs. Who else is working on AI projects? 🚀"
- **Response Idea**: "Congratulations on the launch!"
- **Tone**: Supportive

## 🎯 Conclusion

While the daily goal feature's UI and persistence work correctly, the core functionality of tracking usage is broken due to backend API failures. Users can set goals but cannot track progress, significantly limiting the feature's usefulness. The system needs immediate backend fixes to properly track and increment usage counters.

**Priority**: HIGH - Core feature functionality is broken
