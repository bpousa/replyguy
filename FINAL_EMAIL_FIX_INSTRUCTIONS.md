# FINAL EMAIL CONFIRMATION FIX

## Two Options to Fix This NOW:

### Option 1: Update Supabase Email Template (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/aaplsgskmoeyvvedjzxp/auth/templates
2. Click on "Confirm signup" template
3. Change the Confirmation URL to point to our new handler:
   ```
   {{ .SiteURL }}/auth/v1/verify?token={{ .TokenHash }}&type={{ .Type }}&redirect_to=https://replyguy.appendment.com/auth/confirm
   ```

This will use our new `/auth/confirm` route which handles PKCE tokens properly.

### Option 2: Use Direct Confirmation URL
1. In the same template, use this simpler approach:
   ```
   https://replyguy.appendment.com/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type={{ .Type }}
   ```

This bypasses Supabase's redirect entirely and goes straight to our handler.

## Why The Current Setup Fails:
1. Supabase email confirmation with PKCE tokens requires client-side handling
2. The redirect from Supabase to /auth/callback doesn't include the session
3. Our database triggers might be interfering with Supabase's session creation

## Test After Making Changes:
1. Create a new account
2. Check email and click confirmation link
3. You should be logged in and redirected properly

## If Still Not Working:
Run this SQL to check for issues:
```sql
-- Check if email confirmations are being blocked
SELECT * FROM auth.users 
WHERE email LIKE 'antoni.mike%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

The new `/auth/confirm` route will handle both PKCE and regular tokens properly.
