# Stripe Integration Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the critical fixes applied to the ReplyGuy Stripe integration to resolve payment and subscription issues.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Authentication in Checkout Route
**Problem**: The checkout API was using dummy user IDs (`temp-{timestamp}`) instead of authenticated users.
**Solution**: 
- Added proper Supabase authentication to `/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`
- Now requires users to be signed in before creating checkout sessions
- Links Stripe customers to actual user accounts

### 2. ✅ Missing Database Function
**Problem**: `get_current_usage` function was called but didn't exist in the database.
**Solution**:
- Created migration `20250626041133_create_get_current_usage_function.sql`
- Function now properly returns monthly usage statistics

### 3. ✅ Usage Tracking Implementation
**Problem**: The system wasn't tracking when users generated replies or memes.
**Solution**:
- Added usage tracking to `/api/process/route.ts`
- Tracks both reply and meme generation
- Updates `user_usage` table with detailed metadata

### 4. ✅ Plan ID Validation
**Problem**: API expected `['basic','pro','business','enterprise']` but database had `['free','pro','business']`
**Solution**:
- Updated checkout route validation to match database plan IDs
- Fixed plan ID enum to: `['free', 'pro', 'business']`

### 5. ✅ Usage Limit Enforcement
**Problem**: Users could exceed limits without any blocking or upgrade prompts.
**Solution**:
- Added 429 status code responses when limits are reached
- Implemented upgrade modal trigger in dashboard
- Shows clear usage information to users

### 6. ✅ Upgrade Modal Integration
**Problem**: Upgrade modal was linking to `/auth/signup` instead of Stripe checkout.
**Solution**:
- Created new default export in `upgrade-modal.tsx`
- Integrated with Stripe checkout API
- Shows proper plan options and pricing

### 7. ✅ Usage Dashboard Component
**Problem**: No way for users to see their current usage and limits.
**Solution**:
- Created `UsageDashboard` component
- Integrated into settings page
- Shows:
  - Current usage vs limits
  - Subscription tier
  - Next billing date
  - Available features

### 8. ✅ Stripe Webhooks Verification
**Problem**: Uncertainty about webhook configuration status.
**Solution**:
- Created verification script `verify-stripe-webhooks.ts`
- Confirmed webhooks are properly configured
- All required events are being handled

## Database Changes Made

1. **Function**: `get_current_usage(p_user_id UUID)`
   - Returns current month's usage statistics
   - Handles timezone-aware calculations

2. **Usage Tracking**: 
   - `track_daily_usage` function calls added to process endpoint
   - Tracks metadata including cost, processing time, and features used

## New Features Added

1. **Usage Dashboard** (`/settings`)
   - Real-time usage visualization
   - Progress bars for each limit type
   - Direct upgrade and billing management buttons

2. **Upgrade Modal**
   - Triggered on 429 errors
   - Direct Stripe checkout integration
   - Clear pricing and feature display

3. **Verification Scripts**
   - `verify-stripe-webhooks.ts` - Check webhook configuration
   - `test-payment-flow.ts` - End-to-end payment testing

## Testing the Complete Flow

1. **As a logged-in user**:
   ```javascript
   // Test checkout
   fetch('/api/stripe/checkout', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       planId: 'pro',
       billingCycle: 'monthly'
     })
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
   ```

2. **Test card for Stripe**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

3. **Verify limits are enforced**: Generate replies until you hit the limit

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Database Indexes** (Low Priority)
   - Add indexes for performance optimization
   - Focus on frequently queried columns

2. **Price ID Configuration**
   - Update database with correct Stripe price IDs
   - Choose which product set to use (multiple duplicates exist)

## Environment Variables Required

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ...
```

## Support & Monitoring

- **Webhook Events**: Monitor at https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/events
- **Failed Payments**: Check Stripe dashboard for payment failures
- **Usage Tracking**: Query `user_usage` table for detailed analytics

- ✅ Usage is tracked accurately
- ✅ Limits are enforced with upgrade prompts
