**Author:** Gemini
**Date:** July 4, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/write-like-me-enhancements`

---

## 1. Overview

This report details the work completed to implement the **"Write Like Me"** feature. The goal was to take the existing, non-functional UI components and build the necessary backend infrastructure and AI logic to make the feature fully operational. 

The feature allows users to provide sample tweets, have them analyzed by an AI model to create a unique "style profile," and then use that profile to generate new replies that mimic their personal writing style.

## 2. Detailed Implementation Steps

The implementation was broken down into four main parts: database schema, backend API, frontend integration, and AI logic modification.

### 2.1. Database Schema (`user_styles` table)

A new database migration was created to support this feature.

*   **New File:** `supabase/migrations/20250704_create_user_styles_table.sql`

This migration creates the `public.user_styles` table, which is designed to store all data related to a user's personalized writing styles. 

**Table Schema:**

| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | `UUID` | Primary Key |
| `user_id` | `UUID` | Foreign Key to `public.users`, cascade on delete. |
| `name` | `TEXT` | A user-defined name for the style (e.g., "Professional Voice"). |
| `sample_tweets` | `TEXT[]` | An array of tweets provided by the user for analysis. |
| `is_active` | `BOOLEAN` | If `true`, this is the user's default style for generation. |
| `style_analysis`| `JSONB` | **Crucial field.** Stores the structured JSON output from the GPT-4o style analysis. |
| `analyzed_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Timestamp for when the style was last analyzed. |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Timestamp for style creation. |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ`| Timestamp for the last update. |

**Supporting Database Objects:**

*   **Indexes:** Created on `user_id` and `(user_id, is_active)` for efficient lookups.
*   **RLS Policy:** A comprehensive Row Level Security policy, `"Users can manage their own styles"`, was implemented to ensure a user can only perform CRUD operations on their own style entries. This is enforced via `auth.uid() = user_id`.
*   **`set_active_style` Function:** A PostgreSQL function that handles the logic of ensuring only one style can be active for a user at any given time. It performs this atomically in the database to prevent race conditions.
*   **`trigger_set_timestamp` Trigger:** A standard trigger to automatically update the `updated_at` field on any modification.

### 2.2. Backend API (`/api/user-style`)

A new API route was created to handle all logic related to managing user styles.

*   **New File:** `app/api/user-style/route.ts`

This route provides the following RESTful endpoints, all protected by Supabase server-side authentication:

*   `GET /api/user-style`: Fetches all styles belonging to the authenticated user.
*   `POST /api/user-style`: Creates a new style. It takes a `name` and an array of `sampleTweets`.
*   `PUT /api/user-style`: Updates a style. It can update the `name`, re-analyze `sampleTweets`, or set a style as `isActive` by calling the `set_active_style` database function.
*   `DELETE /api/user-style`: Deletes a specified style.

**Core AI Logic - Style Analysis:**

The most critical part of the `POST` and `PUT` endpoints is the call to the `analyzeStyleWithGPT` function. 

*   **Model Used:** `gpt-4o`
*   **Process:** This function takes the user's sample tweets and sends them to the GPT-4o Chat Completions API with a specific prompt instructing it to analyze the writing style.
*   **Structured Output:** It uses the `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` feature of the API to guarantee the output is a valid JSON object. This JSON, containing traits like `tone`, `formality`, `emojiUsage`, etc., is then stored directly in the `style_analysis` JSONB column of the `user_styles` table.

### 2.3. Frontend Integration

The existing UI components were updated to connect to the new, functional backend.

*   **Modified File:** `app/components/write-like-me-settings.tsx`
    *   The `fetch`, `create`, `update`, and `delete` functions within this component, which were previously placeholders, are now fully implemented to make authenticated requests to the `/api/user-style` endpoints.
    *   The component now accurately reflects the state of the user's styles from the database.

*   **Modified File:** `app/components/reply-form.tsx`
    *   The `useEffect` hook that was previously making a placeholder call to `/api/user-style` now correctly fetches the user's styles.
    *   It checks if any style has `is_active: true`. If so, it enables the "Write Like Me" switch in the UI, making the feature available for use.

### 2.4. Core AI Logic Integration

Finally, the core reply generation pipeline was modified to use the newly created style profiles.

*   **Modified File:** `app/api/process/route.ts`
    *   This orchestrator route now checks if the `useCustomStyle` flag is passed from the frontend.
    *   If `true`, it fetches the user's active style from the `user_styles` table.
    *   It then passes the `style_analysis` JSON object to the final generation step.

*   **Modified File:** `app/api/generate/route.ts`
    *   The `requestSchema` was updated to accept the `customStyle` object.
    *   The `buildGenerationPrompt` function was significantly updated. It now dynamically constructs a new section within the prompt called `--- YOUR CUSTOM STYLE ---`.
    *   This new section explicitly lists the analyzed style characteristics (tone, formality, etc.) and instructs the `claude-3-5-sonnet` model to adhere to this style when crafting the reply, overriding the more generic style instructions.

## 3. Impact Analysis & Potential Issues

*   **Performance & Latency:**
    *   **Area of Impact:** The creation and updating of styles in the settings page.
    *   **Analysis:** The `analyzeStyleWithGPT` function introduces an external API call to OpenAI, which will add a few seconds of latency to these specific actions. This is a necessary trade-off for the feature's quality. Reply generation itself is not impacted, as it only involves a fast database read.
    *   **Recommendation:** Monitor the latency of the OpenAI API. No immediate action is required.

*   **Cost:**
    *   **Area of Impact:** OpenAI API usage.
    *   **Analysis:** This feature introduces costs from the `gpt-4o` model. The cost is incurred *per-analysis* (i.e., when a style is created or its samples are updated), not *per-reply-generation*. This is a very cost-effective approach.
    *   **Recommendation:** Keep an eye on the OpenAI spending dashboard. The cost should be minimal unless users are constantly creating/updating styles.

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   **Area of Impact:** User experience when style analysis or management fails.
    *   **Analysis:** The backend API includes `try...catch` blocks and returns 500 errors on failure. The frontend uses `react-hot-toast` to display these errors. 
    *   **Recommendation:** The error messages are currently generic (e.g., "Failed to create style"). It would be beneficial in the future to pass more specific error details from the backend to the frontend for a better user experience.

*   **Security:**
    *   **Area of Impact:** Data access control.
    *   **Analysis:** The implementation relies heavily on Supabase's RLS policies and server-side authentication (`createServerClient`). This is a robust security model that prevents users from accessing or modifying styles that do not belong to them. No new direct security risks have been introduced.
    *   **Recommendation:** As always, ensure the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` are kept secure in the production environment and are not exposed on the client-side.

## 4. Deployment & Verification

To deploy this feature, please follow these steps:

1.  **Apply Database Migration:** Navigate to the Supabase SQL Editor for the production project and execute the entire content of `supabase/migrations/20250704_create_user_styles_table.sql`.
2.  **Set Environment Variables:** Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set in the Vercel production environment variables.
3.  **Merge and Deploy:** Merge the `feature/write-like-me-enhancements` branch into `main` and deploy to Vercel.

**Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] **Create Style:** As a user, navigate to the settings page and create a new style with at least 3 sample tweets. Verify that the process completes successfully and the new style appears in the list.
- [ ] **Verify in DB:** Check the `user_styles` table in Supabase to confirm a new row was created with the correct `user_id`, and that the `style_analysis` column contains a valid JSON object.
- [ ] **Activate Style:** Toggle the switch to make the new style active. Verify the UI updates and only one style is marked as active.
- [ ] **Enable in Form:** Go to the main dashboard. The "Write Like Meâ„¢" toggle in the reply form should now be visible and enabled by default.
- [ ] **Test Generation (Enabled):** Generate a reply with the toggle on. The resulting reply should noticeably reflect the characteristics of the sample tweets provided.
- [ ] **Test Generation (Disabled):** Turn the toggle off and generate another reply. The output should revert to the standard, generic style.
- [ ] **Edit & Delete:** Verify that editing the name/samples of a style and deleting a style works as expected from the settings page.
