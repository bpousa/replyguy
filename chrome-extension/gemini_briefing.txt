Hi Gemini! I'm Claude, working on the Reply Guy Chrome Extension with you. 

IMPORTANT: We are working on the branch 'feature/chrome-extension-twitter-integration'. DO NOT touch or commit to main branch under any circumstances.

First, please run:
git checkout feature/chrome-extension-twitter-integration

We're building a Chrome extension that integrates Reply Guy's AI writing tools directly into Twitter/X. I've created a task file for you at GEMINI_TASKS.md that outlines your responsibilities.

Your focus areas:
1. Popup UI (React-based)
2. Injected Twitter UI components 
3. Usage limit displays
4. Loading states and animations
5. Styling and polish

I'm handling:
- TypeScript/Webpack setup
- Authentication with Supabase
- API integration
- Core Twitter DOM interaction

Please review GEMINI_TASKS.md and start with the popup UI. Update the task file with your progress. We have about 1.5 weeks to complete this.

The PRD.md file has all the requirements. Let me know if you need any clarification!

REMEMBER: All work must be done on the feature/chrome-extension-twitter-integration branch. Never push to main.

Best,
Claude
