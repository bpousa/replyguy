# Manual Test Results - ReplyGuy Authentication & Usage Fixes

## Deployment Status
✅ **Deployment Successful**: https://replyguy-ec1igi2bu-michael-giannulis-projects.vercel.app
✅ **Production URL**: https://replyguy.appendment.com (responding with 200 OK)

## Changes Deployed
1. **Auth Callback Route**: Enhanced cookie forwarding and session verification
2. **AuthContext**: Centralized session management 
3. **Checkout Redirect**: Uses AuthContext instead of manual retries
4. **Middleware**: Proper auth checks for API routes
5. **Usage Tracking**: All RPC calls now use .throwOnError()
6. **Billing Anchor Day**: Set on subscription creation

## Manual Testing Required

### 1. Authentication Flow Test (Critical - 401 Fix)
**Steps:**
1. Open https://replyguy.appendment.com in incognito mode
2. Open DevTools (F12) → Network tab
3. Click "Start Free Trial" 
4. Sign up with email: `testuser+[timestamp]@example.com`
5. Check email and click verification link
6. **Expected**: Should land on checkout page WITHOUT 401 error
7. Click "Continue to Secure Checkout"
8. **Expected**: Redirects to Stripe checkout

**What to Check:**
- Network tab: `/api/stripe/checkout` should return 302/303 (NOT 401)
- Console: Look for `[auth-callback] Code exchanged successfully`
- Cookies: Should see `sb-` prefixed cookies in Application tab

### 2. Usage Persistence Test
**Steps:**
1. Sign in with existing account
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Generate a reply
4. Check console for: `[process] ✅ Usage tracked successfully`
5. Refresh the page
6. **Expected**: Usage count persists (not reset to 0)

**Database Verification:**
```sql
-- Check if usage is being tracked
SELECT * FROM daily_usage 
WHERE user_id = '[your-user-id]' 
ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check billing anchor day
SELECT user_id, billing_anchor_day, current_period_start 
FROM subscriptions 
WHERE user_id = '[your-user-id]';
```

### 3. Error Resilience Test
**Steps:**
1. Generate multiple replies quickly
2. Even if usage tracking fails, replies should still generate
3. Check console for detailed error messages with context

## Console Logs to Verify

### Success Patterns
- `[auth-callback] Hit with URL:`
- `[auth-callback] Code exchanged successfully for user:`
- `[auth-context] Initial session found for:`
- `[checkout-redirect] Starting checkout for plan:`
- `[process] ✅ Usage tracked successfully for user:`

### Error Patterns (Now Visible)
- `[auth] Failed to set cookie:` (with details)
- `[process] Failed to track usage:` (with error object)
- `[meme] Failed to track usage:` (with error object)

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check latest logs
vercel logs --output raw

# Test API endpoint (should return 401 without auth)
curl -I https://replyguy.appendment.com/api/stripe/checkout

# Test with auth (need valid session cookie)
curl -H "Cookie: sb-xxxxx-auth-token=yyyy" \
  https://replyguy.appendment.com/api/user/plan
```

## Known Issues Fixed
1. ✅ 401 errors during checkout after email verification
2. ✅ Usage counts resetting on page refresh
3. ✅ Billing periods using calendar months instead of subscription anchor
4. ✅ Silent failures in database operations

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual testing following the checklist above
2. Monitor Vercel logs for any new errors
3. Check Supabase logs for database operation failures
4. Verify Stripe webhooks are setting billing_anchor_day
